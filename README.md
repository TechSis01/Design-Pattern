# Design-Pattern
This is a task I submitted, for my internship with Genesys Tech Hub called " Learnable". For this task this is what we were asked to do:
Create a telephone class. It should expose 3 public methods - AddPhoneNumber, RemovePhoneNumber, and DialPhoneNumber.
Update the telephone class, so it uses the observer pattern (have methods to add, remove and notify observers)
Create a class for the observer, it should have a method that can be called by the telephone class to notify it. 
Have the telephone class notify the observers any time a phone number is dialed. 
Add two observers to the telephone class

 The first one should print the phone number
  The second one should print `Now Dialling 2347023232`
  
  At the moment 
  29th January 2023, 8:54pm , there is just one feature lacking to add to this task.
  But I should be able to update it soon, once I have the time off school.
